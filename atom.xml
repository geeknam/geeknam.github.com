    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hey there! This is my new blog powered by <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octropress</a> and hosted on Github.
Octopress was exactly what I was looking for in a blog engine
(Yes, code snippets should be built out of the box in a blog).
I&#8217;ve had Blogger previously but ever since I switched it to the new theme, all my github gists
were not able to display. So I abandoned it. I might migrate the posts from Blogger here, however I&#8217;ll mainly
focus on writing about Python and Django in this one. That&#8217;s about it, stay tuned for the next post. :wq</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Finally got time to continue developing Push Contacts. I&#8217;ve gotten a nerve-wrecking problem while developing with C2DM
applications. When the app supposed to get the push message, it didn&#8217;t respond to it. Looking at the logs I encountered
an error stack related to GTalk (with TalkProvider tag). Decided to google the problem and the solution was to sign out
of GTalk on the phone.</p>

<p>Ok now a tip related to Google App Engine development. I just added a new feature to Push Contacts which is allowing
users to reply to the latest SMS received. I had to retrieve the email of the user the bot is chatting with to find
which phone number to send the SMS to. Took a look at guru.appspot.com source code and decided to use
xmpp_handlers.CommandHandler. Used this method text_message(self, message) and message.sender supposed to return the
sender of a message but instead it returned an IM formatted string. Here is how you can retrieve the email.</p>

    <id>http://geeknam.github.com/blog/2010/11/28/tonidoplug</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yes, <a href="http://tonidoplug.com" title="TonidoPlug">TonidoPlug</a> is a new toy that I&#8217;ve gotten last week. It is a basically a plug computer that can act likea home server. The hardware specs are the same as SheevaPlug with 1.2GHz ARM and 512MB RAM and 512MB Flash. The best thing
about it is the energy consumption ranging from 5-10 Watts.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>So what&#8217;s the difference between TonidoPlug and SheevaPlug? The main and the most noticeable difference is the built-in
software that TonidoPlug provides which makes it really easy to get started with. It&#8217;s seriously just plug-and-play and
you will get all kinds of stuffs you need: torrent (yes torrenting 24/7 is leet), music player (that allows streaming),
sharing files and photos, mounting drives.</p>

<p>But the problem with this is the limitation of applications you can install. What if you want to run an rsync server or
install a LAMP stack? Luckily there is an open source project called PlugApps that allows users to have more
flexibility. Some kind souls have compiled Arch Linux and port it to work on a SheevaPlug hardware. They named it
Plugbox. SheevaPlug naturally runs on Ubuntu 9.04 but apparently Ubuntu has dropped support for ARM that&#8217;s why Arch
Linux would be a perfect suit.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m currently trying to run Plugbox from my external hard drive that has 2 partitions but TonidoPlug doesn&#8217;t seem to
boot from it. I&#8217;m gonna dive deeper into this. Will update the blog once I get it to work.</p>

<p><strong>Edited</strong><br/>
Ok, like finally I got TonidoPlug booting from external hard drive but it still runs on Tonido (Ubuntu 9.04). There&#8217;s
no way I can make it boot from  external hard drive with PlugBox. The problem was with reboot command, I had to make a
cold boot (plug and unplug the power source) in order for the plug to boot into my Samsung G3. I&#8217;ve recently installed awesome
stuff like:</p>

<ul>
<li>webmin (for sysadmin)</li>
<li>gitosis (for git repos)</li>
<li>mt-daapd (iTunes Server)</li>
<li>ettercap (to monitor my home network)</li>
<li>lsyncd (to synchronize files)</li>
<li>nginx (for reverse proxy and web server)</li>
<li>django (web apps running with gunicorn)</li>
<li>transmission (torrent server)</li>
</ul>
