    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hey there! This is my new blog powered by <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octropress</a> and hosted on Github.
Octopress was exactly what I was looking for in a blog engine
(Yes, code snippets should be built out of the box in a blog).
I've had Blogger previously but ever since I switched it to the new theme, all my github gists
were not able to display. So I abandoned it. I might migrate the posts from Blogger here, however I'll mainly
focus on writing about Python and Django in this one. That's about it, stay tuned for the next post. :wq</p>
