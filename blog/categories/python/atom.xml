    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Having played with Capistrano before, I suddenly had an urge to find its Pythonic alternative. After few google searches, I stumbled upon Fabric. It's basically a "python library and command-line tool for streamlining the use of SSH for application deployment or systems administration tasks". Spent few minutes trying to write functions to deploy Django applications to my Linux server and I have to say, Fabric's API is really easy to use, very customizable (it's as easy as wrapping up your shell commands in a python function) and more importantly it has Django integration which I'm gonna need the most. Having said all these, here's the video demo I recorded while messing around with Fabric, enjoy:</p>

<p>P/S: django-nose, nosegrowl2 and tdaemon were used in order to show notification of testing results (just FYI)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Finally got time to continue developing Push Contacts. I've gotten a nerve-wrecking problem while developing with C2DM
applications. When the app supposed to get the push message, it didn't respond to it. Looking at the logs I encountered
an error stack related to GTalk (with TalkProvider tag). Decided to google the problem and the solution was to sign out
of GTalk on the phone.</p>

<p>Ok now a tip related to Google App Engine development. I just added a new feature to Push Contacts which is allowing
users to reply to the latest SMS received. I had to retrieve the email of the user the bot is chatting with to find
which phone number to send the SMS to. Took a look at guru.appspot.com source code and decided to use
<code>xmpp_handlers.CommandHandler</code>. Used this method <code>text_message(self, message)</code> and message.sender supposed to return the
sender of a message but instead it returned an IM formatted string. Here is how you can retrieve the email.</p>

<p>``` python
class XMPPHandler(xmpp_handlers.CommandHandler):</p>

<pre><code>def text_message(self, message):
    idx  = message.sender.index('/')
    user = message.sender[0:idx]
    logging.debug(user)
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>
