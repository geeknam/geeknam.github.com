Hey there! This is my new blog powered by [Octropress](http://octopress.org/) and hosted on Github. 
Octopress was exactly what I was looking for in a blog engine 
(Yes, code snippets should be built out of the box in a blog). 
I've had Blogger previously but ever since I switched it to the new theme, all my github gists
were not able to display. So I abandoned it. I might migrate the posts from Blogger here, however I'll mainly
focus on writing about Python and Django in this one. That's about it, stay tuned for the next post. :wq
